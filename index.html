    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is my website. So far it's home only to my PC-98 scoring guides, but that may change in the future. If you come across any bugs or anything you think should be changed, feel free to tell me on Discord at Christian Azinn#4022.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Azinn, an American high school student. I play Touhou (obviously), mostly PoDD and LLS Lunatic Scoring, but I also cycle through playing a number of other games 
        including Minecraft, EVE Online, Tetris, Cities: Skylines, and more. I'm also interested in a range of topics from computer science to public transport and many things in between. 
        Any topic or game I'm interested in, I tend to be <i>really</i> interested in, so ask me about it!</p>
    <p>Touhou-wise, I currently hold the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxpWmERbvS4">LLS Hard ReimuA</a>
        , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zq6ms9PBwA">LLS Lunatic ReimuA</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2nHVuZ1Res">LLS Lunatic ReimuB</a> 
        world records, with an emphasis on Lunatic ReimuB. I also enjoy scoring <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1637418769">PoDD Lunatic Chiyuri</a>. I also have most Lunatic 1ccs (can't be bothered to finish them) and a LLS LNB.</p>
    <p>PC-98 scoring is fairly underrepresented, so I made this site to host my guides on PC-98 scoring (and give me some HTML/CSS/whatnot practice). I hope that these guides will help players interested in scoring 
        get into scoring these games, as I think they're quite fun to score. Currently I only know the intricacies of PoDD and LLS scoring, and so my guides here are on those. If you have a guide you'd like me to put up, ask me!</p>
    <p>Please note that I don't claim to be the most knowledgeable person on these games. If anything, that title probably goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KirbyComment">KirbyComment</a>, whose materials have helped me 
        and others immensely, and who knows a <i>lot</i> about everything PC-98. I'm just a decent player trying to consolidate scattered information in one place so that it's as accessible as possible for the general public.</p>
    <p>Special thanks to KirbyComment, Haniyasuko Okina, pearl, nrook, yeashie, and Miler for PC-98 things. Also thanks to Nylilsa for site inspiration.</p>

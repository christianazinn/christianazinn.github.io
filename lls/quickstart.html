    <h1>Quickstart Guide</h1>
    <p>New to LLS scoring? Not sure what to do? Don't worry, you don't need to know what category you want to main when you begin. Hopefully the information listed below will help you make a decision!</p>
    <p>First, try out each shot and difficulty and see what you like. Higher difficulties give higher scores, but are harder to play, and Lunatic even adds in annoying pellets shot at random by stage enemies. Each shottype has its own merits (for the most part), which are detailed more later. While you should play around with the game a little before you dive into scoring, here are some possibly useful pieces of information to start with:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty select is handled in the Options menu.</li>
        <li>Scoring always uses default starting resources (3 lives, 2 bombs) and forbids continues.</li>
        <li>There is no automatic item collection line like the Windows games. You'll need to pick up items manually.</li>
        <li>There is no visible hitbox when you focus. However, you can approximate your hitbox as <span style="color:red">Reimu</span>'s purple ponytail or the middle of <span style="color:yellow">Marisa</span>'s hair.</li>
        <li>Pressing Esc, then Q, is a fast way to return to the main menu.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now we'll talk about what difficulty and shottype is right for you!</p>

    <h2 id="diff">Difficulty Overview</h2>
        <p class="minilist"><strong><span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span></strong>: For beginners to Touhou in general. Plays differently to the other difficulties to the extent that it won't be covered in this guide, due to missing Stage 6.</p>
        <p class="minilist"><strong><span style="color:aqua">&#9956 Normal</span></strong>: For those who have some experience with Touhou and want to try scoring. The lowest difficulty to use more or less the same resource route as Lunatic, meaning it's covered in this Lunatic-focused guide and gives you transferable skills. If you're looking to start scoring seriously but want to take it easy, particularly if you're at or slightly below Hard 1cc level, start here.</p>
        <p class="minilist"><strong><span style="color:magenta">&#9956 Hard</span></strong>: For those who are fairly experienced with Touhou, but not the most well-versed in scoring. Also a very good starter difficulty. Offers much of the Lunatic scoring experience with slightly less difficult patterns and no annoying RNG pellets. If you're at or slightly below Lunatic 1cc level, you can choose to start here.</p>
        <p class="minilist"><strong><span style="color:red">&#9956 Lunatic</span></strong>: For those experienced with Touhou and confident in their abilities. Not the best difficulty to start with because of how much of a nuisance the random pellets are. Offers the best score potential, but also the hardest patterns. If you're comfortable with the game or scoring in general, or above Lunatic 1cc level, you can start here.</p>
        <p class="minilist"><strong><span style="color:crimson">Extra</span></strong>: Short but sweet category, around Hard difficulty. Takes place in a singular stage, independent of the "maingame" (other difficulties). Also a fun category, but I don't know enough about it to cover it in this guide.</p>

    <p>In general, if you can 1cc the game on a given difficulty, you should try and pop down a difficulty to start. I wouldn't recommend Easy scoring, though, and this is of course only a general thing: if you want to score a specific difficulty, there's nothing stopping you! You'll learn all the patterns eventually.</p>
    <p>I recommend dropping down a difficulty at first because the gameplay requirements are much higher on a given difficulty scoring than 1cc: you need to be able to use bombs in planned locations and survive certain relatively difficult patterns, leaving you with much fewer resources than on a 1cc. Little changes between difficulties, as well, except on <span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span> and <span style="color:crimson">Extra</span>, so scoring the other difficulties to start will give you transferable skills to use if you want to play a different category.</p>
    <p>As you get more familiar with the game and the strategies used, feel free to hop around categories! There's nothing wrong with going to score <span style="color:aqua">Normal</span> after starting on <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span>, or moving up to <span style="color:magenta">Hard</span> from <span style="color:aqua">Normal</span>. I just would't move up more than one difficulty at a time, because of how big the difference in pattern difficulty is.</p>
    <p>Each of the difficulties marked with a &#9956 use effectively the same resource route and will all be covered in this guide. <strong>This guide is written with <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span> in mind, however, so take that into consideration when perusing it for different difficulties.</strong></p>

        <p style="color:lightgreen" class="tldr">&#9881 TL;DR: Pick between Normal, Hard, and Lunatic, they're all similar, and this guide is written for Lunatic, so it translates to the other difficulties. Consider dropping a difficulty from what you're comfortable with when 1ccing.</p>

    <h2 id="shot">Shottype Overview</h2>
        <p class="minilist"><span style="color:red">ReimuA</span>: Standard homing shot. Has extremely easy stages and doesn't need to worry about being under a boss to damage them. Low damage. Gets Marisa as Stage 4 boss.</p>
        <p class="minilist"><span style="color:red">ReimuB</span>: Traditional wide shot. Has <strong>the best scoring potential of any shot in the game</strong>. Difficult to use effectively. Low damage but good shotgun. Gets Marisa as Stage 4 boss.</p>
        <p class="minilist"><span style="color:yellow">MarisaA</span>: High-power piercing lasers. Has <strong>the best damage in of any shot in the game</strong>. Easy to use on any difficulty by any player, offering good survival but relatively mediocre scoring. Cuts through bosses like a knife through butter. Gets Reimu as Stage 4 boss.</p>
        <p class="minilist"><span style="color:yellow">MarisaB</span>: Uh... rapid-fire bullets? Objectively bad shot, basically a meme. Low damage and thin spread. Pointless to use, but if you want to try her, go ahead. Gets Reimu as Stage 4 boss.</p>

    <p>In general, you'll likely want to use either <span style="color:yellow">MarisaA</span> or <span style="color:red">ReimuB</span>. Most people choose <span style="color:yellow">MarisaA</span> because she makes the run much easier, but I personally prefer <span style="color:red">ReimuB</span> for her higher score potential. You should try each shot and see which one you like best!</p>
    <p>The character you choose will also affect the Stage 4 boss fight - you fight the other character. Both fights are difficult, with <span style="color:yellow">Marisa</span> being much more RNG-heavy (and offering more score) than <span style="color:red">Reimu</span>. It's certainly something to consider when picking a shot!</p>

        <p style="color:lightgreen" class="tldr">&#9881 TL;DR: Play around with shots to see what fits you, keeping in mind that shot choice affects the Stage 4 boss.</p>

    <h2 id="next">Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Play around with the shots and difficulties to figure out which one you like best. Once you have this figured out, go check out the <a href="scoring.html">scoring information page</a> to learn about how the LLS scoring system works (just skim through the Major section), then hit up the <a href="route.html">route details page</a> to learn more about and choose the route that you'll practice and use!</p>

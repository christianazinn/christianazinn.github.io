    <h1>Introduction to LLS Scoring</h1>
    <p>You're here! Great! That probably means you're interested in scoring LLS. Regardless of how much you know about the game itself, this guide will hopefully walk you through the process of learning how to do exactly that.</p>
    <p>First, some things that need to be said. This guide is applicable for any shot on <span style="color: aqua">Normal</span>, <span style="color:magenta">Hard</span>, and <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span>, although specific resource routes may differ between shots and difficulties. I personally am most familiar with the <span style="color:red">Reimu</span> shots, particularly the <span style="color:red">Lunatic ReimuB</span> category, so coverage for other shots may be spotty. The resource route is not applicable to <span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span> due to it not having Stage 6, and <span style="color:crimson">Extra</span> is not covered here because I don't know much about its scoring. However, the mechanics are the same. Keep in mind, however, <strong>this entire guide is written with <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span> in mind</strong>, even though it applies to other difficulties as well.</p>
    <p>This guide is also not an entire-game guide, it assumes you know a baseline of mechanics and jargon. If you don't know what graze or dream is, that's fine (just check out the <a href="#jargon">jargon dictionary</a>) but if you don't know how to focus or bomb, that's going to be an issue. If you aren't confident you know enough, do check out the <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Lotus_Land_Story/Gameplay">wiki gameplay page</a> for the basics (although don't trust it for anything further! The wiki is usually very inaccurate). </p>
    <p>Think you know what you're doing? Great. Let's get started.</p>

    <h2 id="guide">How to Use This Guide</h2>
    <p>This guide is segmented into nine sections: one for each stage in detail (including the stage midboss(es) and boss), a page on the scoring mechanics, a page on the route, and this one, which serves as the overview and jargon dictionary. Feel free to take the time to brush up on <a href="scoring.html">scoring mechanics</a> if you don't know them yet, since understanding the system is crucial to understanding what's going on in the rest of the guide. The guide will also use a variety of terms that you might not understand; these are mostly defined in the <a href="#jargon">jargon dictionary</a>, and if they're not, tell me to add it!</p>
    <p>This guide includes several routes and possible alterations, so you can tailor your route for your own skill level and score goal. Some strategies are only used in certain routes and some routes do certain sections differently, and these are marked as such when they show up, like so:</p>

    <p style="color:greenyellow">&#9956 Safe route only: </p>

    <p>Such specifications, as well as difficulty names (<span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span>, <span style="color: aqua">Normal</span>, <span style="color:magenta">Hard</span>, <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span>, and the occasional <span style="color:crimson">Extra</span>), shottype/character names (<span style="color:red">Reimu</span>, <span style="color:yellow">Marisa</span>), <span style="color:blueviolet">point</span>/<span style="color:red">power</span> item names, and <span style="color:green">bomb</span>, <span style="color:orange">suicide</span>, and <span style="color:lightcoral">extend</span> locations, will be color-coded to make it easier to find relevant information.</p>
    <p>Each page contains a whole lot of information about its relevant topic, and they are written under the assumption that you are reading them in order. If you only want information about a certain section, though, feel free to skip ahead! Each page contains a number of clips of sections, and some text explaining it as well, so you can choose what to use depending on what learning style you enjoy most.</p>
    <p>That should be all, the rest should be fairly self-explanatory. If you know what category you're playing, choose a page to go to next from the navigation bar above (try the route page first); if not, keep reading!</p>

    <h2 id="start">Where to Start</h2>
    <p>Not sure where to start out? Don't worry, you don't need to know what category you want to main when you begin. Hopefully the information listed below will help you make a decision!</p>
    <p>First, try out each shot and difficulty and see what you like. Higher difficulties give higher scores, but are harder to play, and Lunatic even adds in annoying pellets shot at random by stage enemies. Each shottype has its own merits (for the most part), which are detailed more later. Below are overviews for each difficulty and shot to help you decide.</p>

    <h3 id="diff">Difficulty Overview</h3>
    <p><strong><span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span></strong>: For beginners to Touhou in general. Plays differently to the other difficulties to the extent that it won't be covered in this guide, due to missing Stage 6.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color:aqua">&#9956 Normal</span></strong>: For those who have some experience with Touhou and want to try scoring. The lowest difficulty to use more or less the same resource route as Lunatic, meaning it's covered in this Lunatic-focused guide and gives you transferable skills. If you're looking to start scoring seriously but want to take it easy, particularly if you're at or slightly below Hard 1cc level, start here.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color:magenta">&#9956 Hard</span></strong>: For those who are fairly experienced with Touhou, but not the most well-versed in scoring. Also a very good starter difficulty. Offers much of the Lunatic scoring experience with slightly less difficult patterns and no annoying RNG pellets. If you're at or slightly below Lunatic 1cc level, you can choose to start here.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color:red">&#9956 Lunatic</span></strong>: For those experienced with Touhou and confident in their abilities. Not the best difficulty to start with because of how much of a nuisance the random pellets are. Offers the best score potential, but also the hardest patterns. If you're comfortable with the game or scoring in general, or above Lunatic 1cc level, you can start here.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color:crimson">Extra</span></strong>: Short but sweet category, around Hard difficulty. Takes place in a singular stage, independent of the "maingame" (other difficulties). Also a fun category, but I don't know enough about it to cover it in this guide.</p>

    <p>In general, if you can 1cc the game on a given difficulty, you should try and pop down a difficulty to start. I wouldn't recommend Easy scoring, though, and this is of course only a general thing: if you want to score a specific difficulty, there's nothing stopping you! You'll learn all the patterns eventually.</p>
    <p>I recommend dropping down a difficulty at first because the gameplay requirements are much higher on a given difficulty scoring than 1cc: you need to be able to use bombs in planned locations and survive certain relatively difficult patterns, leaving you with much fewer resources than on a 1cc. Little changes between difficulties, as well, except on <span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span> and <span style="color:crimson">Extra</span>, so scoring the other difficulties to start will give you transferable skills to use if you want to play a different category.</p>
    <p>As you get more familiar with the game and the strategies used, feel free to hop around categories! There's nothing wrong with going to score <span style="color:aqua">Normal</span> after starting on <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span>, or moving up to <span style="color:magenta">Hard</span> from <span style="color:aqua">Normal</span>. I just would't move up more than one difficulty at a time, because of how big the difference in pattern difficulty is.</p>
    <p>Each of the difficulties marked with a &#9956 use effectively the same resource route and will all be covered in this guide. <strong>This guide is written with Lunatic in mind, however, so take that into consideration when perusing it for different difficulties.</strong></p>

    <h3 id="shot">Shottype Overview</h3>
    <p><span style="color:red">ReimuA</span>: Standard homing shot. Has extremely easy stages and doesn't need to worry about being under a boss to damage them. Low damage. Gets Marisa as Stage 4 boss.</p>
    <p><span style="color:red">ReimuA</span>: Traditional wide shot. Has <strong>the best scoring potential of any shot in the game</strong>. Difficult to use effectively. Low damage but good shotgun. Gets Marisa as Stage 4 boss.</p>
    <p><span style="color:yellow">MarisaA</span>: High-power piercing lasers. Has <strong>the best damage in of any shot in the game</strong>. Easy to use on any difficulty by any player, offering good survival but relatively mediocre scoring. Cuts through bosses like a knife through butter. Gets Reimu as Stage 4 boss.</p>
    <p><span style="color:yellow">MarisaB</span>: Uh... rapid-fire bullets? Objectively bad shot, basically a meme. Low damage and thin spread. Pointless to use, but if you want to try her, go ahead. Gets Reimu as Stage 4 boss.</p>

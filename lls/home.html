    <h1>Introduction to LLS Scoring</h1>
    <p>You're here! Great! That probably means you're interested in scoring LLS. Regardless of how much you know about the game itself, this guide will hopefully walk you through the process of learning how to do exactly that.</p>
    <p>First, some things that need to be said. This guide is applicable for any shot on <span style="color: aqua">Normal</span>, <span style="color:magenta">Hard</span>, and <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span>, although specific resource routes may differ between shots and difficulties. I personally am most familiar with the <span style="color:red">Reimu</span> shots, particularly the <span style="color:red">Lunatic ReimuB</span> category, so coverage for other shots may be spotty. The resource route is not applicable to <span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span> due to it not having Stage 6, and <span style="color:crimson">Extra</span> is not covered here because I don't know much about its scoring. However, the mechanics are the same.</p>
    <p>This guide is also not an entire-game guide, it assumes you know a baseline of mechanics and jargon. If you don't know what graze or dream is, that's fine (just check out the <a href="#jargon">jargon dictionary</a>) but if you don't know how to focus or bomb, that's going to be an issue. If you aren't confident you know enough, do check out the <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Lotus_Land_Story/Gameplay">wiki gameplay page</a> for the basics (although don't trust it for anything further! The wiki is usually very inaccurate). </p>
    <p>Think you know what you're doing? Great. Let's get started.</p>

    <h2 id="guide">How to Use This Guide</h2>
    <p>This guide is segmented into nine sections: one for each stage in detail (including the stage midboss(es) and boss), a page on the scoring mechanics, a page on the route, and this one, which serves as the overview and jargon dictionary. Feel free to take the time to brush up on <a href="scoring.html">scoring mechanics</a> if you don't know them yet, since understanding the system is crucial to understanding what's going on in the rest of the guide. The guide will also use a variety of terms that you might not understand; these are mostly defined in the <a href="#jargon">jargon dictionary</a>, and if they're not, tell me to add it!</p>
    <p>This guide includes several routes and possible alterations, so you can tailor your route for your own skill level and score goal. Some strategies are only used in certain routes and some routes do certain sections differently, and these are marked as such when they show up, like so:</p>
    <p style="color:greenyellow">&#9956 Safe route only: </p>
    <p>Such specifications, as well as difficulty names (<span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span>, <span style="color: aqua">Normal</span>, <span style="color:magenta">Hard</span>, and <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span>), shottype/character names (<span style="color:red">Reimu</span>, <span style="color:yellow">Marisa</span>), and <span style="color:blueviolet">point</span>/<span style="color:red">power</span> item names will be color-coded to make it easier to find relevant information.</p>
    <p>Each page contains a whole lot of information about its relevant topic, and they are written under the assumption that you are reading them in order. If you only want information about a certain section, though, feel free to skip ahead! Each page contains a number of clips of sections, and some text explaining it as well, so you can choose what to use depending on what learning style you enjoy most.</p>
    <p>That should be all, the rest should be fairly self-explanatory. If you know what category you're playing, choose a page to go to next from the navigation bar above; if not, keep reading!</p>

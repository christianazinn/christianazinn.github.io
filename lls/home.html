    <h1>Introduction to LLS Scoring</h1>
    <p>You're here! Great! That probably means you're interested in scoring LLS. Regardless of how much you know about the game itself, this guide will hopefully walk you through the process of learning how to do exactly that.</p>
    <p>First, some things that need to be said. This guide is applicable for any shot on <span style="color: aqua">Normal</span>, <span style="color:magenta">Hard</span>, and <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span>, although specific resource routes may differ between shots and difficulties. I personally am most familiar with the <span style="color:red">Reimu</span> shots, particularly the <span style="color:red">Lunatic ReimuB</span> category, so coverage for other shots may be spotty. The resource route is not applicable to <span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span> due to it not having Stage 6, and <span style="color:crimson">Extra</span> is not covered here because I don't know much about its scoring. However, the mechanics are the same.</p>
    <p>This guide is also not an entire-game guide, it assumes you know a baseline of mechanics and jargon. If you don't know what graze or dream is, that's fine (just check out the <a href="#jargon">jargon dictionary</a>) but if you don't know how to focus or bomb, that's going to be an issue. If you aren't confident you know enough, do check out the <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Lotus_Land_Story/Gameplay">wiki gameplay page</a> for the basics (although don't trust it for anything further! The wiki is usually very inaccurate). </p>
    <p>Think you know what you're doing? Great. Let's get started.</p>

    <h2 id="guide">How to Use This Guide</h2>
    <p>This guide is segmented into seven sections: one for each stage in detail (including the stage midboss(es) and boss), and this one, which serves as the overview for game mechanics and the routes used. Feel free to take the time to brush up on <a href="#mechanics">scoring mechanics</a> if you don't know them yet, since understanding the system is crucial to understanding what's going on in the rest of the guide. The guide will also use a variety of terms that you might not understand; these are mostly defined in the <a href="#jargon">jargon dictionary</a>, and if they're not, tell me to add it!</p>
    <p>This guide includes several routes and possible alterations, so you can tailor your route for your own skill level and score goal. Some strategies are only used in certain routes and some routes do certain sections differently, and these are marked as such when they show up, like so:</p>
    <p style="color:greenyellow">&#9956 Safe route only: </p>
    <p>Such specifications, as well as difficulty names (<span style="color:greenyellow">Easy</span>, <span style="color: aqua">Normal</span>, <span style="color:magenta">Hard</span>, and <span style="color:red">Lunatic</span>), shottype/character names (<span style="color:red">Reimu</span>, <span style="color:yellow">Marisa</span>), and <span style="color:blueviolet">point</span>/<span style="color:red">power</span> item names will be color-coded to make it easier to find relevant information.</p>
    <p>Each page contains a whole lot of information about its relevant topic, and they are written under the assumption that you are reading them in order. If you only want information about a certain section, though, feel free to skip ahead! Each page contains a number of clips of sections, and some text explaining it as well, so you can choose what to use depending on what learning style you enjoy most.</p>
    <p>That should be all, the rest should be fairly self-explanatory. Keep reading to learn more about the scoring system!</p>

    <h2 id="mechanics">Scoring Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Lotus Land Story's score system is fairly simple as Touhou scoring systems go, but there are still a lot of ways to gain points. Here is a list of all ways to gain score in LLS.</p>

    <h3>Low/Negligible Score Gains</h3>
    <h4>Tick Points</h4>
    <p>Tick points, or shooting score, are the points you get from having your shots land on an enemy or killing an enemy. The tick points are generally in the range of thousands of points per second for hitting shots or a thousand or so points on an enenmy kill, which are almost negligible numbers. However, in cases where you can farm tick points for little to no risk, there's no reason not to do so (e.g. Elly's scythe).</p>

    <h4>"Low-tier" Bullet Cancels</h4>
    <p>The lesser of two types of bullet cancels, "low-tier" bullet cancels refer to the score gained from cancelling bullets when you die, bomb, gain full power, or a boss changes phases. In this case, each bullet on screen that is cancelled grants 1,000 points, and each bullet that attempts to spawn but is cancelled (e.g. during a bomb or death iframes) grants 100 points. Usually fairly negligible, but there are some cases in which you can gain a decent amount of points, such as the stage 6 final rings power cancel. </p>

    <h4>Boss Phase Transitions</h4>
    <p>Every time you shoot down a boss phase, it drops five <span style="color:blueviolet">point</span> items (or <span style="color:red">power</span> items, if below full power; one is guaranteed to be a <span style="color:red">super power</span> item in this case), but it also grants a flat bonus, shown in yellow 12,800s that pop up around the boss. These add up to a decent amount of score over the course of the run, but considering that you should always get the same bonuses every run, it isn't something to worry about.</p>

    <h4>Marisa Orbs</h4>
    <p>When playing as Reimu, you receive Marisa as the stage 4 boss, who periodically respawns destructible orbs that shoot attacks. Destroying an orb grants 50,000 points flat, which is not negligible but low enough to be ignored below high level scoring. Each wave spawns 4 orbs, and you can usually safely milk 9 waves before Marisa's timer (which is an oddity in and of itself) runs out. It's a little score bump, but not convenient below high level scoring, because of how RNG Marisa is and how easy it is to die to her.</p>

    <h4>Other Items</h4>
    <p>Items that are not <span style="color:blueviolet">point</span> or <span style="color:red">power</span> items, namely bomb, 1up, and full power items, grant a flat 1,000 points each upon collection.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Major Score Gains</h3>
    <h4><span style="color:red">Power Items</span></h4>
    <p>There are two types of power items, regular and super. Regular power items advance your power level by 1, and a super by 10, up until full power at 127 power; both are worth a mere 10 points below full power. At full power, successive regular power items collected increase the power item value by 1 step, and supers by 5 steps. The value increases by 10 from 10 to 100, then by 100 from 100 to 1,000, then by 500 from 1,000 to 12,500, and finally capping at 12,800 points. At 12,800, supers will be collected for 25,600 points; at all other times, they will be collected for the regular power item value. Power item value does not change with screen location.</p>

    <h4><span style="color:blueviolet">Point Items</span> and <span style="color:blue">Dream Bonus</span></h4>
    <p></p>

    <h4>Bombs</h4>
    <p>A bomb, when used, will magnet all items on screen to your location and collect them at double value, whatever their value is at your location; because of this, planned score bombs are vital to scoring. The attraction is not instant; if the bomb runs out while the item is still coming towards you, it will stop and begin to fall as usual. This is most noticeable in two sections in stage 4: the opener and the semicircle of dolls near the end.</p>

    <h4>"High-tier" Bullet Cancels</h4>
    <p></p>

    <h4>Graze</h4>
    <p>When you get near a bullet but don't get hit by it, the game counts that bullet as "grazed," and increments the graze counter. Each bullet can only be grazed once, and the counter caps at 999 per stage and resets on stage transitions. Each graze point gives a fixed amount of score directly, depending on the difficulty: <span style="color:greenyellow">1,000</span>/<span style="color: aqua">2,500</span>/<span style="color:magenta">4,000</span>/<span style="color:red">5,000</span>/<span style="color:crimson">25,600</span>. Graze also plays a role in the Stage Clear Bonus, discussed next.</p>

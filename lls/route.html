    <h1>Route Details and Choices</h1>
    <p>As a game heavily focused on <span style="color:bisque">graze</span> and <span style="color:green">bombs</span> for score, a proper route is vital to a good score - both a resource route, so you know where to <span style="color:green">bomb</span>, <span style="color:orange">suicide</span>, and <span style="color:bisque">graze</span>, and a general dodging route, so you know how to dodge everything the game throws at you. However, higher-scoring routes tend to be more difficult, as they require more difficult maneuvers to be executed, and they use fewer bombs for survival to use more for scoring. As such, I've listed a few routes of different difficulties which you can use depending on your survival ability and taste for risk. <strong>Don't feel the need to stick to one route throughout the entire game, mix and match strats to your taste!</strong></p>

    <h2 id="resources">Resource Overview</h2>
    <p>Resources (<span style="color:coral">lives</span> and <span style="color:green">bombs</span>) are limited in LLS and you must choose wisely where to use them. 1cc-style panicbombing will have to be minimized, although you should still leave room in your chosen route for some human error - forcing yourself to follow a strict route is a good way to enter reset hell and earlygame jail. You get a total of <strong><span style="color:coral">10 extra lives</span> and <span style="color:green">31 bombs</span></strong> to use throughout the game, ideally all of which you use on strategic suicides and score/survival bombs.</p>
    <p>Standard starting resources are 3/2 lives/bombs in the Options menu. <span style="color:coral">Extends (1ups)</span> are given for score and dropped as items by certain stage midbosses and enemies, and <span style="color:green">bombs</span> are dropped as items by certain stage midbosses and enemies and given at the end of each stage. <span style="color:coral">Score extends</span> are given at 3, 8, 15, 22, and 30 million points, meaning you should always hit all of them; <span style="color:coral">1up items</span> are dropped by the Stage 3 midboss, second appearance of the Stage 4 midboss, and the penultimate enemy in Stage 6. <span style="color:green">Bomb items</span> are dropped by the Stage 2 midboss, first appearance of the Stage 5 midboss, and third-last enemy in Stage 6. These resource drops will need to be routed around!</p>
    <p>That being said, it's important to <strong>learn how to recover from mistakes and route deviations</strong>, so you can improvise on the fly to get the most score out of what you have remaining. If you accidentally bomb somewhere to save yourself from death, save a bomb later to get back on track, or execute an alternate strategy. It's a skill that comes with time, so don't worry if you can't do it at first! Use a more lenient route and move on to more strict routes as you gain experience.</p>
    <p><span style="color:bisque">Graze</span> will also be covered here; you only need enough to cap the counter (999) in the later stages, and in the earlier stages you can choose to graze certain things but it can be risky. You can fiddle with the graze amounts to your liking, but in general you'll want to farm the best and easiest patterns on each stage for graze.</p>

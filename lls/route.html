    <h1>Route Details and Choices</h1>
    <p>As a game heavily focused on <span class="graze">graze</span> and <span class="bomb">bombs</span> for score, a proper route is vital to a good score - both a resource route, so you know where to <span class="bomb">bomb</span>, <span class="life">suicide</span>, and <span class="graze">graze</span>, and a general dodging route, so you know how to dodge everything the game throws at you. However, higher-scoring routes tend to be more difficult, as they require more difficult maneuvers to be executed, and they use fewer bombs for survival to use more for scoring. As such, I've listed a few routes of different difficulties which you can use depending on your survival ability and taste for risk. <strong>Don't feel the need to stick to one route throughout the entire game, mix and match strats to your taste!</strong></p>

    <h2 id="resources">Resource Overview</h2>
    <p>Resources (<span class="life">lives</span> and <span class="bomb">bombs</span>) are limited in LLS and you must choose wisely where to use them. 1cc-style panicbombing will have to be minimized, although you should still leave room in your chosen route for some human error - forcing yourself to follow a strict route is a good way to enter reset hell and earlygame jail. You get a total of <strong><span class="life">10 extra lives</span> and <span class="bomb">31 bombs</span></strong> to use throughout the game, ideally all of which you use on strategic suicides and score/survival bombs.</p>
    <p>Standard starting resources are 3/2 lives/bombs in the Options menu. <span class="life">Extends (1ups)</span> are given for score and dropped as items by certain stage midbosses and enemies, and <span class="bomb">bombs</span> are dropped as items by certain stage midbosses and enemies and given at the end of each stage. <span class="life">Score extends</span> are given at 3, 8, 15, 22, and 30 million points, meaning you should always hit all of them; <span class="life">1up items</span> are dropped by the Stage 3 midboss, second appearance of the Stage 4 midboss, and the penultimate enemy in Stage 6. <span class="bomb">Bomb items</span> are dropped by the Stage 2 midboss, first appearance of the Stage 5 midboss, and third-last enemy in Stage 6. These resource drops will need to be routed around!</p>
    <p>That being said, it's important to <strong>learn how to recover from mistakes and route deviations</strong>, so you can improvise on the fly to get the most score out of what you have remaining. If you accidentally bomb somewhere to save yourself from death, save a bomb later to get back on track, or execute an alternate strategy. It's a skill that comes with time, so don't worry if you can't do it at first! Use a more lenient route and move on to more strict routes as you gain experience.</p>
    <p><span class="graze">Graze</span> will also be covered here; you only need enough to cap the counter (999) in the later stages, and in the earlier stages you can choose to graze certain things but it can be risky. You can fiddle with the graze amounts to your liking, but in general you'll want to farm the best and easiest patterns on each stage for graze.</p>

        <h3 id="rank">A Quick Word About Rank</h3>
        <p>LLS, like many early Touhou games and arcade games in general, employs a rank system that dynamically changes pattern difficulty with performance. Higher rank directly increases pattern density, bullet speed, and bullet fire rate, meaning that everything gets more difficult to dodge. Some patterns are much more noticeably difficult on high rank than low rank. Here is a list of what makes rank go up and down:</p>

        <h4>Factors that increase rank:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Playtime: rank will naturally increase over time</li>
            <li>Gaining an extend</li>
            <li>Picking up items</li>
            <li>Getting a large high-tier bullet cancel</li>
            <li>Clearing a stage without dying or clearing without bombing (irrelevant to scoring)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Factors that decrease rank:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Dying or bombing</li>
            <li>Allowing items to fall off the screen</li>
            <li>Getting a particularly small high-tier bullet cancel</li>
            <li>Failing to kill a boss and letting it time out</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each of these affects rank by a different amount (e.g. dying drops the rank more than missing a point item), but you can see that the actions conducive to scoring also directly increase rank! While there are some difficult patterns you will probably bomb, expect to stay on high rank for most of the run. It's unavoidable when scoring at any level, so you'll just need to practice and persevere through the harder patterns!</p>

            <p class="tldr">&#9881 TL;DR: Scoring makes the game harder.</p>

        <h3 id="blergh">Difficult Survival Sections</h3>
        <p>There are several patterns throughout the game that are particularly hard to dodge, especially on "run nerves." Here's a list of most of them, ranked in decreasing order of difficulty (as judged by yours truly), so you can figure out where to add/remove survival bombs and understand why certain patterns are bombed. Of course, you should practice each to see whether the order is different for you, and to make sure you have a fighting chance should you deviate from the route and end up having to dodge one of these.</p>

        <ol>
            <li class="lunatic">&#9956 Stage 5 End-of-Stage Rings</li>
            <li class="lunatic">&#9956 Hikariko Opener Patterns (S4 Midboss)</li>
            <li class="okina">Stage 6 Yuuka Final</li>
            <li class="okina">Kurumi Phase 2 (S2 Boss)</li>
            <li class="marisa">Marisa (S4 Boss, in general)</li>
            <li class="marisa">Reimu Phases 2/4 (S4 Boss)</li>
            <!--what else-->
        </ol>

        <p>There are more patterns that are debatably difficult, but most will be fine with practice. These are six (eight?) of the most difficult in the game, so if you're going to need to bomb anything for survival, it'll likely be these. As you keep practicing, see if you can reduce the number of resources you need for each of these, and see if there are any other difficult patterns you might need to bomb.</p>

            <p class="tldr">&#9881 TL;DR: You're going to need to bomb some patterns so you don't die, even though it's not score optimal.</p>

# Christian Azinn's GitHub page

Link to page: christianazinn.github.io

This site hosts my Touhou guides and things I find cool, among other things I might put up in the future.

If you have anything to talk about, whether it be something you want to be changed or added, or you just want to chat, you can contact me on Discord at Christian Azinn#4022. You could create an issue on GitHub but I probably won't realize it's there for a while.

Thanks to Nylilsa for inspiration for the site. Full credits list is on the site homepage.

If you're here on the GitHub source page, you're probably interested in the code. It's a hot mess (I'm only just learning HTML/CSS), but if you inexplicably have any interest in taking a look at or copying anything I do, feel free to do so.
